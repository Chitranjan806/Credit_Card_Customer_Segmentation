    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>

    <h3>Why Segmentation of Customers?</h3>
    <b>Customer segmentation is necessary. You can’t serve every customer the same product, experience, or ad as they won’t resonate with it the same. Doing so results in low-click through rate, engagement, and conversions.
      <br>
      That’s where segmenting comes into the picture. Finding all of the unique groups that make up a bigger customer base lets you get into customer’s heads and give them exactly what they want, improving their experience and boosting revenue.</b>
