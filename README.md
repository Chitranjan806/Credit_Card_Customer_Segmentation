    <h1>Credit Card Customer Segmentation</h1>
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p style="color:#336699;">To develop a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy.</p>
    <h3>Why Segmentation of Customers?</h3>
    <p><b>Customer segmentation is necessary. You can’t serve every customer the same product, experience, or ad as they won’t resonate with it the same. Doing so results in low-click through rate, engagement, and conversions.
      <br>
      That’s where segmenting comes into the picture. Finding all of the unique groups that make up a bigger customer base lets you get into customer’s heads and give them exactly what they want, improving their experience and boosting revenue.</b></p>
